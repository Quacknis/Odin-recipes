This has been a fun and insightful road to say the least. Ever since I dabbled myself a little into editing json from a game i enjoyed a lot, i grew increasingly curious to how everything really works. Now I'm set into a learning path to satisfy this taste for knowledge.

I have been learning really fast if I can pat myself in the back haha. I guess  this is coming from someone who always enjoyed these kind of related things, it feels like "normal" the more I think about it. And the more I dig into this subject, i get this weird feeling that I should have done this way wayyyy sooner. Everything is just fitting like a missing puzzle into myself, like I finally found my identity in this world.

Now, remember one thing for when you read this again in the future, I'm not only doing this for myself, but I'm doing for everything in this world that is most dear. Hold onto it tight and persevere not matter how bad or harsh things might be.

Be strong for Krey
